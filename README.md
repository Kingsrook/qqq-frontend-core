##Setup for Development 
1. run target "clean-install-modules" after cloning
2. run target build to compile and create deployable packages 
3. run target test to run the jest test suite 

##Testing
The Jest Target Profiles should be working, allowing you to open a testing file and run or dedug any of the tests directly.  

This system should also allow you to track coverage and engage with the coverage tools in real-time
